I'm a software developer with a lot of love for algorithms and math.

- I'm working on an sliding tile puzzle solver (pattern databases and permutation ranking algorithms, interesting stuff!) ♟️
- I'm learning statistics/linear algebra 📈
- I'm always interested in collaborating on projects related to art and music (I've made visuals for live performance before, it was a blast!) 🎨
- You can reach me through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laureravier/"> LinkedIn </a>, I'd love to have a coffee ☕
- Fun fact: I participated in my first obstacle run last year 🏃‍♀️
<!-- - Bad habit: I don't upload everything I'm working on to github 😬 -->
